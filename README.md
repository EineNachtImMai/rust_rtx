# Important things to note
I did not write all this code. Although I did try to follow the (original post)[https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html], it is written in C, which means i spent 70% of my time trying to translate concepts from a language I didn't understand (C) to a language I am still not proficient in (Rust).
I got a significant amount of help and code from a rust implementation of the post I was following. I did, however, write everything myself and spend a significant amount of time debugging before resorting to using the rust implementation (because this project was intended as a learning experience).
I also wrote custom code for materials and their rendering, as well as for triangle and plane handling (meshes may or may not be in the future plans depending on my motivation).
